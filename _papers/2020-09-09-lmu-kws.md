Abstract
--------

Keyword spotting (KWS) provides a critical user interface for many
mobile and edge applications, including phones, wearables, and
cars. As KWS systems are typically 'always on', maximizing both
accuracy and power efficiency are central to their utility. In this
work we use hardware aware training (HAT) to build new KWS neural
networks based on the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) that achieve
state-of-the-art (SotA) accuracy and low parameter counts. This allows
the neural network to run efficiently on standard hardware (212 μW). We
also characterize the power requirements of custom designed
accelerator hardware that achieves SotA power efficiency of 8.79 μW,
beating general purpose low power hardware (a microcontroller) by 24x
and special purpose ASICs by 16x.
