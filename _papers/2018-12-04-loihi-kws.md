Abstract
--------

Using Intel's Loihi neuromorphic research chip and ABR's Nengo Deep
Learning toolkit, we analyze the inference speed, dynamic power
consumption, and energy cost per inference of a two-layer neural
network keyword spotter trained to recognize a single phrase. We
perform comparative analyses of this keyword spotter running on more
conventional hardware devices including a CPU, a GPU, Nvidia's Jetson
TX1, and the Movidius Neural Compute Stick. Our results indicate that
for this inference application, Loihi outperforms all of these
alternatives on an energy cost per inference basis while maintaining
equivalent inference accuracy. Furthermore, an analysis of tradeoffs
between network size, inference speed, and energy cost indicates that
Loihi's comparative advantage over other low-power computing devices
improves for larger networks.
