In 2015, we were honored when Nengo 2.0 was selected
for an R&D 100 award.
This week, R&D magazine featured Nengo in its R&D100 Flashback.

If you happen to be in the Washington, DC area
[this year's R&D 100 conference](http://www.rd100conference.com/)
is happening November 2â€“4.
The speaker lineup looks great as usual!
