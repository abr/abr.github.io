- Applied Brain Research Inc. (ABR) released today
  benchmarks showing ABR Nengo DL deep networks
  on the Intel Loihi research chip is
  38x more efficient than leading GPU
  for real-time data deep-learning
- ABR working with customers on applying
  [Nengo](http://nengo.ai/) stack +
  [Loihi](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/research/neuromorphic-computing.html)
  to ioT devices,
  smartphones and driverless cars,
  offering much more efficient alternative to GPUs

**Toronto, Ontario, Canada – Dec. 6, 2018** –
Applied Brain Research Inc. today
released a study comparing the energy-efficiency
of their Nengo Deep Learning toolkit
([Nengo DL](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/introduction.html))
running a real-time, keyword spotting
deep learning network on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic research chip
to traditional hardware.
The results show that
[Nengo DL](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/introduction.html)
on Loihi uses 38x less energy per inference
than an architecturally identical network
running on an NVIDIA Quadro K4000 GPU.

The study also compared the dynamic energy cost
per inference performance of the same deep network
on several other platforms. In each case the
[Nengo DL](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/introduction.html)
on Loihi network consumed significantly less power.
Specifically, the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 edge GPU
consumed 7.3x more energy,
the Intel Xeon E5-2630 CPU 8.2x more
and the Movidius Neural Compute Stick 1.9x more.

"These benchmarking results show that
[Loihi](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/research/neuromorphic-computing.html)
can perform inference on real-time data streams
using standard feed-forward deep networks
with significant efficiency advantages
compared to conventional processor architectures.
ABR's [Nengo DL](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/introduction.html)
software makes these gains accessible
for mainstream use by hiding
the complexity of the underlying
spiking neural network implementation.
This has important implications
for the commercialization outlook for this technology,"
stated [Mike Davies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-davies-71b4542/),
Director, Neuromorphic Computing Lab at Intel Corporation.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about">Dr. Chris Eliasmith</a>,
co-CEO of ABR noted that for this application
these results indicate that,
"[Nengo DL](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/introduction.html)
on Loihi outperforms all of these alternative platforms
on an energy cost per inference basis
while maintaining near-equivalent inference accuracy."
Furthermore, an analysis of tradeoffs between network size,
inference speed, and energy cost indicates
that Loihi's comparative advantage over
other low-power computing devices improves
for larger networks.

Computing with artificial spiking neurons
directly in software and hardware,
known as "neuromorphics," has long been pursued
as a means of exploiting how
the brain computes intelligence so efficiently.
The lessons learned can be applied
to improve artificial intelligence.
"In this study, ABR has delivered
strong empirical evidence that
the long-sought-after efficiencies
of computing with spiking neurons
now can be realized in commercially valuable applications
using Nengo DL on Loihi", said
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about">Peter Suma</a>,
co-CEO of ABR.

ABR's Nengo DL toolkit allows deep learning networks
to run on neuromorphic hardware, CPUs and GPUs.
This provides one development environment
in which to define power-efficient, real-time,
neuromorphic networks that can then be run
on all supported hardware platforms,
including the Intel Loihi neuromorphic research chip.
Neuromorphic edge-AI computing with Nengo and Loihi
reduces power costs
while preserving the performance of deep networks.
