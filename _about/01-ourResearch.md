title: Our Research

In addition to Spaun, the research team at ABR has made advances in deep spiking networks, (spiking and on-spiking) adaptive control, (spiking and non-spiking) hierarchical reinforcement learning and much more.  We have developed new kinds of recurrent neural networks that can outperform LSTMs on a variety of tasks, while being fully implementable in spikes.  We have built the first applications on Intel's new neuromorphic hardware, Loihi, demonstrating state-of-the-art power and performance on deep learning and adaptive control applications. 

We have also developed an inexpensive and accessible spiking hardware platform using FPGAs, that can introduce new users to the world of neuromorphics.  We continue to push the boundaries of cognitive computing on neuromorphic platforms, and build ever larger and more functional systems driving new robotic functionality, better and more efficient video and audio processing, and high-speed action-perception applications.  And this is just the stuff we can tell you about...
