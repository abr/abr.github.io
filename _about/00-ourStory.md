ABR was spun out of the Computational Neuroscience Research Group (CNRG) at the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience (CTN) at the University of Waterloo, about two years after the Spaun model was published.  Just before that, Peter Suma had joined the CNRG to see if their approach to building neural and cognitive models might have commercial applications.

This approach includes the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA), which form the theoretical foundations of Spaun.  Suma brought his extensive business background and the rest of the founders brought their unique technical and theoretical contributions to Spaun.  Together they started ABR to push neuromorphic computing as a new platform, combining new kinds of hardware and novel algorithms to get state-of-the-art power, speed, and accuracy across a range of AI applications.
