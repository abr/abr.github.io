The typical CPUs most smartphones use
could never handle a system like Siri on the device.
But Dr. Chris Eliasmith,
a theoretical neuroscientist and co-CEO
of Canadian AI startup Applied Brain Research,
is confident that **a new type of chip is about to change that**.

Eliasmith and his team are keenly focused
on building tools that would **allow
a community of programmers to deploy AI algorithms**
on these new cortical chips.
