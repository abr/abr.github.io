But the point of Spaun is not to build an artificial brain either.
It’s a test-bed for neuroscience—a **platform that we can use
to understand how the brain works**.
Does Region X control Function Y?
Build it and see if that’s true.
If you knock out Region X, will Spaun's mental abilities
suffer in a predictable way? Try it.
