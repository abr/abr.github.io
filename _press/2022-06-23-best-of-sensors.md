**Waterloo, Ontario, Canada â€“ June 23, 2022** -
[Applied Brain Research](https://www.appliedbrainresearch.com/) today
announces it has been named a finalist in the Innovative Product of
the Year category of the [Best of Sensors
Awards](https://www.sensorsconverge.com/sensorsconvergecom/awards) for
their ultra-efficient edge [AI Time-Series Processor (TSP) chip](
{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _products/tsp.md %}). The ABR TSP offers
sensor, IoT device, car, appliance, consumer electronics and all
device makers the ability to process large-scale time-series data at
the edge. The chip enables full speech recognition, robust natural
language understanding, anomaly detection, pattern recognition,
machine health monitoring, and more.

"Applied Brain Research is honored to be a finalist in the Best of
Sensors Awards for our TSP chip," said ABR's Co-CEO, Peter
Suma. "Cloud reliance is a large barrier to entry to ubiquitous speech
and sensor processing. Our chip removes this barrier by bringing
large-scale time series capabilities to the edge."

The ABR TSP is a low-SWaP, edge, time-series AI processor chip that is
used to implement ultra-low-SWaP embedded sensor data processing, AI
speech processing and language processing systems. The ABR TSP
implements on-chip ABR's patented optimally efficient time-series and
signal processing algorithm, the [Legendre Memory Unit (LMU)](

For a few dollars, device companies can now communicate their device
set-up and manuals to users in a natural and intuitive way without a
cloud connection. ABR TSP embeds training-free, natural language voice
interfaces, including troubleshooters and user manuals, and will
revolutionize device interaction.

ABR offers sensors the ability to process complex AI edge event
detection, over longer windows of signal time, for far less power,
with longer battery life, while only sending events for further
processing.

Charlene Soucy, Senior Director, Sensors & Electronics said, "Again
this year the innovation in the sensors industry did not disappoint
with new, innovative ground-breaking technologies and individuals
doing spectacular work. The Best of Sensors Awards was created to
recognize the industry's best innovations. We congratulate Applied
Brain Research Inc. on being named a finalist."

Submissions were judged based on the value to the marketplace, the
impact of the problems it solves or issues it addresses and the
uniqueness of the design. The judges for the Best of Sensors awards
were Roger Grace, Roger Grace Associates, Jack Gold, J. Gold
Associates, Matt Hamblen, Fierce Electronics, Brian Zahnstecher,
PowerRox, Leonard Lee, neXt Curve, and Mary Ann Maher, SoftMEMS.

Award winners will be announced on June 28 at Sensors
Converge. Sensors Converge will be co-located with [Embedded
Technologies Conference & Expo](https://www.embeddedtechconf.com/),
[Autonomous Technologies
Conference](https://www.sensorsconverge.com/sensorsconvergecom/autonomous-technologies),
and [Metaverse Global
Congress](https://www.metaverseglobalcongress.com/).

### About Applied Brain Research
Applied Brain Research, Inc. designs AI inspired by the efficiency of
brain circuits and backed by neuroscientists and AI engineers. ABR
builds AI chips and makes software to build low-power embedded AI
systems used in devices like smartphones, drones, robots, cars,
cameras, clothing, wearables, and sensors. ABR discovered an AI
time-series processing algorithm called the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU)
from this work. The LMU algorithm outperforms LSTMs and Transformers
on time-series applications by a factor of 10x. ABR has used the LMU
to create an ultra-efficient time series processor chip which will be
available in Q4 of 2023.
