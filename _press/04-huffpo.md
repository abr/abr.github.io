Ask Spaun a question, and it hesitates a moment before answering,
pausing for about as long as humans do.
Give Spaun a list of numbers to memorize,
and it falters when the list gets too long.
And Spaun is better at remembering the numbers
at the beginning and end of a list
than at recalling numbers in the middle,
just like people are.
