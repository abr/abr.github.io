**Waterloo, Canada and Silicon Valley, CA. January 4, 2023** - [Applied Brain
Research Inc.](https://appliedbrainresearch.com/) (ABR), a [CESÂ® 2023 Innovation
Awards
Honoree](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2023/Honorees/A/ABR-AI-Time-Series-Processor-(TSP).aspx)
for the ABR [Time Series Processor (TSP) AI chip]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_products/tsp.md %}), has joined the Silicon Catalyst Incubator Program, and ABR
is launching its Time-Series AI Processor (TSP) Family of chips at CES 2023.

Silicon Catalyst is the world's only incubator focused exclusively on
accelerating semiconductor solutions. As a Portfolio Company in the
incubator/accelerator, ABR will have direct access to the products and services
of the Silicon Catalyst comprehensive ecosystem of In-Kind Partners and a wealth
of industry expertise through the advisor and investor network.

ABR's vision is to empower the world's devices with intelligent, concept-level
conversations and decision-making abilities using their family of innovative
Time-Series-Processors (TSP). Whether it's enabling full voice and language
processing on a small, low-power chip for consumer electronics and automotive
applications, processing radar signals faster and for less power, bringing
cloud-sized AI signal processing to the edge, or integrating situational
awareness AI to give robots the ability to understand and respond to complex
commands to interact with people in a natural and intuitive way, the TSP chip
family is poised to revolutionize the way devices sense and communicate.

"The ABR team is developing a breakthrough product family of AI chips which
allow cloud-sized speech and signal AI models to run at the edge at low cost,
power, and latency," stated Taron Verma, Managing Partner at Silicon Catalyst.

"We're very pleased to have them join Silicon Catalyst and applaud their
industry recognition as a recipient of this year's [CES 2023 Innovation Awards
Honoree]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _press/2022-11-21-ces-innovation-awards.md %})."
Attendees to CES can visit the ABR booth in the Canada-Ontario booth in
Venetian Expo Hall D, booth #55429 ([press

"Silicon Catalyst's partners, advisers and sponsors include senior business
executives from every major semiconductor company and bring a wealth of
expertise and connections to help accelerate ABR's business", said Peter Suma,
co-CEO responsible for business development and finance at ABR.

"The senior chip designers and semiconductor CTO advisors at Silicon Catalyst
along with the in-kind partner benefits bring a wealth of experience and tools
that will help us complete our chip development in the coming months", said
Dr. Chris Eliasmith, co-CEO responsible for all science and technology R&D at
ABR.


### About Applied Brain Research
Applied Brain Research Inc.'s new time-series AI processor (TSP) powers the
future of intelligent conversations and decision-making for devices. Our
revolutionary TSP uses 100x less-power, costs 10x less, and runs AI models that
are up to 10x larger than the equivalent processor required for such
workloads. Decades of brain research by ABR's scientists enabled the discovery
of the ultra-efficient AI compression algorithm that powers ABR's new
time-series AI processor (TSP). Device makers can benefit by giving their
products cloud-sized AI capabilities without the usual cost, latency, connection
or power. Devices can implement full voice dialog interfaces and run complex
signal processing on device, while lowering cost. More company and product
information can be found at

### About Silicon Catalyst
Silicon Catalyst is the world's only incubator focused exclusively on
accelerating semiconductor solutions, built on a comprehensive coalition of
in-kind and strategic partners to dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of
development. More than 800 startup companies worldwide have engaged with Silicon
Catalyst and the company has admitted 90 exciting companies. With a world-class
network of mentors to advise startups, Silicon Catalyst is helping new
semiconductor companies address the challenges in moving from idea to
realization. The incubator/accelerator supplies startups with access to design
tools, silicon devices, networking, and a path to funding, banking and marketing
acumen to successfully launch and grow their company's technology
solutions. Over the past seven plus years, the Silicon Catalyst model has proven
to dramatically accelerate a startup's trajectory while at the same time
de-risking the equation for investors.  Silicon Catalyst has been named the
Semiconductor Review's 2021 Top-10 Solutions Company award winner. The Silicon
Catalyst Angels was established in July 2019 as a separate organization to
provide access to seed and Series A funding for Silicon Catalyst portfolio
companies. More information is available at
