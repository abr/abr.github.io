After seeing an ABR adaptive control demo:

You’re taking this to the next level with how it thinks, how it learns, 
and how it reacts...the simulated neural networks you’re creating through 
this can apply to this [robot] -- it’s just a great visualization -- 
but of course this applies to thousands of things.
