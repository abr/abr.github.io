- ABR beats the "most commercially successful AI algorithm [the LSTM]"
  ([Bloomberg,
  2018](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-15/google-amazon-and-facebook-owe-j-rgen-schmidhuber-a-fortune))
  with ABR's brand new LMU algorithm. The Long Short-Term Memory
  (LSTM) algorithm has stood since 1997 as the best AI algorithm for
  processing time series data. It is used in smart speakers, phones,
  cloud services, sensors, cars and robots for everything from speech
  to signal processing and more.
- The LMU is a game-changer for AI-based speech, video, control, music
  and signal processing, providing increased accuracy, greater
  scalability and lower power consumption than the LSTM.
- ABR is working with leading car OEMs, smartphone makers, drone
  users and software companies to implement leading edge speech and
  video AI systems using our new LMUs.

**Toronto, Ontario, Canada â€“ December 27, 2019** -- Applied Brain
Research Inc. (ABR) is unveiling its extended low-power edge-AI
platform at CES 2020 in Las Vegas, Nevada from Jan. 7th to 10th. CES
is the premier showcase for consumer technologies. Applied Brain
Research (ABR) has been selected as one of the emerging technology
Eureka Park companies and will be exhibiting in Booth
#50669 at the Sands Convention Center, Hall G.

"We are very excited to have been selected for our revolutionary,
low-power edge-AI technologies" says Peter Suma, co-CEO of ABR. "ABR
makes AI technologies that radically lower the power required to
compute continuous AI in phones, cars, drones, robots, sensors, and
ioT devices as compared to GPUs. In April, we showed a 100x reduction
in power used for keyword spotting versus GPUs. Recently we
significantly extended our low-power AI platform with the release of
our Legendre Memory Unit (LMU), a full replacement for LSTMs. LMUs are
more accurate, more scalable and lower-power replacements for LSTMs."

The LMU is a new Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm for
continuous-time signal processing that can learn to classify and
predict patterns in signals far more efficiently than the LSTM, the
previous state-of-the-art algorithm. The LMU surpasses the best known
RNN results by LeCun et al. (93.7--94.5 percent) and Bengio et
al. (95.4--95.9 percent) by a full percentage point on the psMNIST
task. LMUs are also more scalable, able to learn temporal dependencies
that span millions of time-steps, unlike LSTMs which are far more
limited. Also unlike LSTMs, LMUs can be computed with neuromorphic
hardware, using far less power to achieve the same or better results
than LSTMs running on GPUs.

LMUs can be used wherever LSTMs are, such as for classification,
learning, and processing of time series data in speech, control, and
analysis of sensor data in robotic motion, speech, handwriting, and
music processing. The game-changing benefits include longer battery
life for smartphones and smart speakers, and longer range for
autonomous cars due to the large reduction in AI compute power.

### About Applied Brain Research Inc. (ABR)

ABR's team of world-leading neuromorphic researchers have more than a
century's worth of combined time researching how brains compute so
efficiently. ABR's team brings that experience to developing our
leading-edge AI hardware and software computing platform. ABR makes
[Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai/), the world's leading multi-platform,
visual neuromorphic software compiler, runtime and spiking
deep-learning edge-AI platform. ABR's team built Spaun, the world's
largest functional brain model, using Nengo. ABR also builds
real-time, full-loop AI "brains" using Nengo for customers in the
military, self-driving car, IoT and smartphone markets.
