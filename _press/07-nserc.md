Dr. Eliasmith has drawn on his experience in
philosophy, neuroscience, systems design engineering
and computer science to develop mathematical theories
of the brain that will make it possible
for scientists to study
the behavioural consequences of brain damage
in a safe, simulated environment,
without damaging a real brain.
It will provide new insights into how the brain actually works.
