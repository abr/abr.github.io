**Waterloo, Ontario, Canada - March 1, 2018** -
At the Intel Lab's Conference Centre on Intel's Jones Farm campus just outside
of Portland, during the Neuro Inspired Computational Elements (NICE) Workshop,
ABR unveiled the first suite of Intel Loihi AI demonstration
applications. The NICE conference brings together a global group of leading
neuromorphic computing scientists, engineers and corporate representatives.

Announced by Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, this past January during his
keynote of the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Intel’s
Loihi chip is manufactured in 14nm process technology and delivers leading
density and performance for a neuromorphic chip. Learning is supported
directly on the chip with programmable learning rules. ABR implemented
several of ABR’s spiking learning rules, demonstrating supervised
learning and reinforcement learning running directly on the Loihi
chip.

Intel showed the first application ever built, a visual object
recognition application for Loihi. ABR then unveiled three
real-time, online learning demonstration AI applications it
created using ABR’s neuromorphic compiler, Nengo, for Loihi.
The applications are: (1) a keyword speech recognition app,
trained using deep learning and converted to a spiking neural
network using ABR’s machine learning to spiking network transfer
methods, (2) an expert online reinforcement learning agent
that visitors could play in a game of tic-tac-toe, (3) a hybrid
neuromorphic robotic controller using online non-linear
adaptive control that moves the Kinova Jaco2 arm to
track an object detected using a vision system trained with deep learning.

ABR developed the applications for Intel in the span of the
eight weeks preceding the workshop. Intel’s Loihi chip performed
flawlessly. ABR’s neural modeling and simulation software, Nengo,
and Intel’s Loihi provide a complete neuromorphic stack for both
low-power, next-generation AI applications development for edge and
cloud AI computing, as well as advanced computational neuroscience
research. ABR is now working on completing the Nengo backend to fully
support Loihi’s features. Loihi will then have access to the full
range of components, networks, and applications already developed on Nengo.

ABR ran these applications demonstrating the breadth of uses
of the Loihi chip, from inference to reinforcement learning to supervised
learning, for the NICE attendees. ABR was honoured to be the first
pre-launch collaboration on Loihi and is excited to soon offer all
of our collective research and commercial partners the full Nengo
software stack to program with Loihi.


### About Nengo

ABR’s Nengo is a neuromorphic compiler for building and simulating
large-scale neural models for AI, robotics and neuroscience uses.
Nengo models are built once and then can run on any of the backends
that Nengo supports, including: CPUs, GPUs, MPI and neuromorphic
hardware such as Loihi, Spinnaker and BrainDrop. Nengo transforms a
functional description of a neural model to a network of spiking or
non-spiking neurons. Nengo provides an extensive framework and set of
libraries for building applications, reducing the overhead for users to
build complex systems. Applications can be constructed with traditional
neural network training methods, such as deep learning, or built using
ABR’s Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and Semantic Pointer Architecture
(SPA; a library of methods to build cognitive applications).

Nengo on a number of measures is the world’s leading neuromorphic
applications tool. Nengo is the result of over 15 years of theory,
research, development and optimization by a team of leading computational
and theoretical neuroscientists from the University of Waterloo. Nengo
runs both from the command line and through an intuitive graphical
user interface. Nengo has been used to build neural networks for
applications ranging from adaptive robotics control to visual
recognition to cognitive tasks such as logical inference and instruction
parsing. Nengo was also used to develop the world's largest functional
brain model, Spaun.

More information about Nengo, the Neural Engineering Framework, and
Spaun can be found at [www.nengo.ai](https://www.nengo.ai).


### About Applied Brain Research

Neural networks have become a necessary tool for advanced computing
applications. A new generation of computing hardware is emerging
designed to efficiently run neural networks, called neuromorphic hardware.
These new chips use far less power than convention processors and are able
to simulate much larger neural networks much faster, paving the
way for efficient embedded processing and further development of
advanced AI computing.

Applied Brain Research (ABR)
[www.appliedbrainresearch.com](https://appliedbrainresearch.com) is the maker
of the leading compiler and operating system for neuromorphic computing,
Nengo. ABR also builds applications with Nengo, such as AI vision and
robotic controllers, for the next major generation of computer
chips referred to as neuromorphic hardware.

ABR was launched out of Dr. Chris Eliasmith’s lab, the Centre for
Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of Waterloo, with his
team of leading computational neuroscience and AI researchers. ABR focuses
on the development and commercialization of technology based on theoretical
neuroscience research, providing the neural development and simulation package,
Nengo, as well as neuromorphic solutions to vision, robotics, and
cognitive tasks.
