    New ABR Technology Lowers Power Consumption by 94% for Always-On Devices

*Enables better keyword speech recognition performance for devices
like smartphones, smart speakers, wearables, and earpieces*

**Waterloo, Ontario, Canada â€“ September 14, 2020** -
[Applied Brain Research](https://www.appliedbrainresearch.com/)
Inc. (ABR) today announced new software and chip-designs that
dramatically lower power consumption for speech-enabled devices such
as wearables, smart-phones, earpieces, smart speakers, and smart
glasses.

ABR's technology uses a new neural-network design, the Legendre Memory
Unit (LMU), that reduces battery power consumption by as much as
[94%](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04465) for on-device AI tasks, such
as spoken keyword processing. This breakthrough technology allows
smart devices to deliver better and more accurate keyword
recognition. It will enable smart-device makers to launch new and
innovative speech-enabled products that consume less power and have
longer battery lives.

The LMU is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that enables lower-power
and more accurate processing of time-varying signals.  The LMU can be
used to build AI networks for all time-varying tasks, such as speech
processing, video analysis, sensor monitoring and control systems.

In late 2019 ABR showed that the LMU significantly outperforms the AI
industry's go-to model for time-series AI processing, the
Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network.  The original LMU paper,
presented at NeurIPS, proved that on the basic task of memorizing a
time-varying signal, the LMU is 1,000,000x more accurate than the
LSTM, while encoding 100x more timesteps. The LMU model is also
smaller, using 500 parameters versus the LSTM's 41,000, a [98%
reduction in network
size](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?showEvent=15733).

ABR's LMU-based keyword recognition system is lower-power and more
accurate than previously available from companies like
[Google](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06720),
[DarwinAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04245), and
[Syntiant](https://www.syntiant.com/post/syntiant-ndp101-microprocessor-receives-linley-group-s-analysts-choice-award). ABR's
low-power keyword spotting technology runs on existing computer chips,
as well as on ABR's new LMU-based chip designs. The new ABR chip
designs yield more power savings than using the LMU software
implementations alone.

ABR's LMU keyword-spotting hardware design consumes 24x less power
relative to off-the-shelf edge hardware and [16x less
power](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04465) than special-purpose
keyword-spotting hardware, while using 91% fewer parameters. ABR's
technology understands spoken command words using only 8.8 millionths
of a watt of electricity, compared with [140 millionths of a
watt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04245) for existing technology used
by device makers today. An ABR-powered keyword-spotting chip alone
would run for more than 38 years on a standard watch battery (1,000
mAh lithium).
