**Toronto, Ontario, Canada â€“ Apr. 2, 2019** --
NBEL Innovation Workshops LTD is thrilled to announce
a new partnership with Applied Brain Research Inc (ABR).
ABR is based in Canada, and is one of the
world's leading neuromorphic engineering companies. ABR is
revolutionizing computing by providing computational solutions based
on the architecture of the brain.

ABR's FPGA neuromorphic compute board, ABRain board, and
ABR's neuromorphic application development software tool-set,
are able to run real-time neural networks quickly and efficiently.

NBEL Innovation Workshops, housed in Biohouse at the
Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, is ABR's exclusive distributor
for the ABRain board in Israel.

This exciting new interface between neuroscience, computer science,
and electrical engineering is anticipated to revolutionize
the way we do computer vision, robotics and computerized cognitive tasks.

"We are very excited to be working closely with Dr. Tsur and his
team at NBEL. Their depth of expertise in neuromorphic computing
hardware and algorithms makes them the ideal partner to help
the researchers and companies in Israel looking to be first-movers
in capitalizing on the advances and power of neuromorphic computing,"
said Peter Suma, co-CEO of ABR.

"At NBEL, we are thrilled to be part of this exciting endeavor
with ABR and look forward to working with our Israeli customers
to deliver cutting-edge neural research and commercial
computational platforms like the ABRain board," said
Dr. Elishai Ezra Tsur, CEO of NBEL Innovation Workshops.
