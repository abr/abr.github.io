**Waterloo, Canada. November 21, 2022** - [Applied Brain Research
Inc.](https://appliedbrainresearch.com/) (ABR) today announced that it has been
named a [CESÂ® 2023 Innovation Awards
Honoree](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2023/Honorees/A/ABR-AI-Time-Series-Processor-(TSP).aspx)
for the ABR [Time Series Processor (TSP) AI
chip]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _products/tsp.md %}). This year's Consumer
Electronics Show (CES) Innovation Awards program received a record-high number
of over 2,100 submissions. The announcement was made ahead of CES 2023, the
world's most influential technology event, happening January 5th to 8th, 2023
in Las Vegas, NV.

The CES Innovation Awards program, owned and produced by the Consumer Technology
Association (CTA), is an annual competition honoring outstanding design and
engineering in 28 consumer technology product categories. Those with the highest
rating receive the "Best of Innovation" distinction. An [elite panel of industry
expert
judges](https://ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Meet-the-CES-2021-Judges.aspx),
including members of the media, designers, engineers, and more, reviewed
submissions based on innovation, engineering and functionality, aesthetics and
design.

ABR's Time Series Processor (TSP) chip is based on their revolutionary new
algorithm for AI signal processing, the provably optimal Legendre Memory Unit
(LMU) neural network. ABR's chip processes time series including speech,
language, audio, biosignals, radio frequency signals, network traffic, and more
at extremely low power levels, with low latency, and at low cost. A two-minute
TSP introduction video is [available online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRzBaLd24mE).

The TSP's real-time, AI processing directly on chip enables device innovations
such as:
- Superior full dialog speech and language capability for a few dollars,
- Complete user voice privacy by processing without requiring the cloud,
- Real-time, multi-channel, accurate signal pattern recognition and anomaly
  detection, and
- Longer lasting batteries for smart, AI-powered devices. The TSP uses less than
  25 milliwatts of power for most applications.

"The LMU algorithm that powers ABR's TSP is a fundamental advance in time series
AI processing," said Dr. Chris Eliasmith, co-CEO of ABR.

"We are honored to have Applied Brain Research's TSP be selected as a CES 2023
Innovation Awards honoree," stated Peter Suma, co-CEO of ABR.
