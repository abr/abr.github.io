The system is explicitly designed for real-world applications.
On a five-year timescale, says Boahen,
"we envision building fully autonomous robots
that interact with their environments
in a meaningful way,
and operate in real-time while [their brains]
consume as much electricity as a cell phone".
Such devices would be much **more flexible and adaptive**
than today's autonomous robots,
and would **consume considerably less power**.
