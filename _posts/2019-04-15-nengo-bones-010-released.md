The Nengo Bones team is happy to announce the release of Nengo Bones 0.1.0.

### What is Nengo Bones?

Nengo Bones is designed to unify the configuration of projects across the
Nengo ecosystem.  For example, many of our repositories use very similar
scripts during CI.  Rather than each repository maintaining its own version
of those scripts, the idea behind Nengo Bones is to maintain those scripts
in a single central repository, which each downstream repo will access.
Nengo Bones uses a templating system, which allows downstream repos to
customize the behaviour while still allowing that behaviour to be easily
updated when a change is made upstream in Nengo Bones.

### How do I use it?

The first step in using Nengo Bones is to define a `.nengobones.yml` config
file.  This stores all the configuration information that Nengo Bones will
use when rendering the templated files.  See
[the documentation](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-bones/examples/configuration.html)
for a demonstration of the available configuration options, or you may find
it useful to look at a `.nengobones.yml` from an
[existing repository](https://github.com/nengo/nengo-dl/blob/master/.nengobones.yml).

Once the `.nengobones.yml` has been filled in, we are ready to use
Nengo Bones.  Whenever possible, Nengo Bones will generate the templated
files automatically, so that they can be updated without any changes in
downstream repos.  However, certain files need to be generated locally and
committed to the repo in order to perform their function (such as the
`.travis.yml` file).  These files can be generated by running

```bash
generate-bones
```
in the root directory of your repository.

This will update all the necessary files, and you can then commit any
changes to your repo.

### What's new?

This is the first official release of Nengo Bones!  Note that this is still
a beta release, so there may be bugs and we do expect Nengo Bones to change
rapidly over the next little while.

### How do I get it?

To install Nengo Bones, we recommend using `pip`:

```bash
pip install nengo-bones
```
