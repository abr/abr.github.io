The [Nengo team](https://www.nengo.ai/people.html)
is chuffed to announce the release of Nengo Extras 0.2.

### What is Nengo Extras?

Nengo Extras contains additional utilities for Nengo
that are not commonly used,
but are useful enough
that they should be publicly accessible.
These extra features include learning rules,
neuron types, domain-specific processes, and more.

### Features

The Nengo Extras 0.2.0 release adds a few new tools,
and has better organized
[documentation](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-extras/).

New to this release are the AML learning rule,
which does one-shot learning of associations
from cue vectors to target vectors.
There is a `Camera` process which can help
connection a webcam to a Nengo model,
and a set of classes to convert Nengo models
to a file format that
[Gephi](https://gephi.org/) understands.

See the [full documentation](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-extras/)
for more details and example usage.
