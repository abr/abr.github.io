In 2015, we were honored when Nengo 2.0 was selected
for an R&D 100 award.
This week, R&D magazine featured Nengo in its
[R&D100 Flashback](http://www.rdmag.com/article/2016/10/r-d-100-flashback-applied-brain-researchs-nengo-20-develops-neural-models).

If you happen to be in the Washington, DC area
[this year's R&D 100 conference](http://www.rd100conference.com/)
is happening November 2â€“4.
The speaker lineup looks great as usual!
