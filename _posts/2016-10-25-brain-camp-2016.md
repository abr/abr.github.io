The goal of the Nengo summer school is to
learn to build state-of-the-art neural or cognitive models using Nengo.
Participants come from all around the world
to learn, collaborate, and enjoy southern Ontario.

Applications will soon open for the 2017 offering of the summer school.
Stay tuned to <http://www.nengo.ca/summerschool>!

Special thanks to Sarah McCrackin for putting this video together!
