  Building off the successful foundations
  and testing done with our commerically
  available ABRain Board,
  we are scaling up to a multi-FPGA neuromorphic system
  able to run millions of neurons in real time.

Working with researchers at the University of Waterloo,
we are designing and testing an architecture
that targets top-of-the-line FPGAs from both Intel and Xilinx.

Our small FPGA boards are just the beginning.
To make neuromorphics easy and fast to deploy,
we're developing scaled-up versions that can target off-the-shelf, large FPGAs.
This will provide a quick route
to get the benefits of neuromorphic computing
sooner rather than later.

This project is still in the early stages,
but has already generated promising results,
showing significantly better performance
for high bandwidth and compute intensive use cases.

Given the large scale,
we're working with collaborators
to develop special communication protocols
to move spiking data efficiently on chip.
