ABR was founded by a group of researchers from the [Computational Neuroscience Research Group](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/)
at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).  We continue to maintain close ties with the CNRG, collaborating
on the development of new brain-inspired technologies.
