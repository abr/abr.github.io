  We have developed a patented adaptive control method
  that guarantees improvement over standard PID control.
  Not only does this algorithm introduce robust self-tuning,
  it can be run efficiently on standard hardware,
  or next generation neuromorphic hardware.

Our novel controller uses machine learning
and artificial intelligence methods
to improve standard industrial control.

These patented techniques build on
decades of research from MIT
into efficient methods for building robust and adaptive controllers
for nonlinear systems.

Regardless of whether you're using
position, force, or any other control target,
our addition of a neural network into the controller
is mathematically guaranteed
to improve the control outcome
compared to even a well-tuned PID controller.

Furthermore, if desired, the controller
will continue to adapt while in use,
to account for unknown or expected deviations
from the original tuning conditions,
whether that's because of wear and tear on the plant,
or a change in environmental dynamics.

Best of all we can implement
the entire controller on state-of-the-art, efficient neuromorphic hardware
(or standard hardware, if you already have it).

If you're not sure that this
will work for your application,
contact us and we'll help you get started,
or work closely with you
to develop the controller to suit your criteria.
