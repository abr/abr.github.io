ABRain board allows you to own
a piece of the neuromorphic revolution.

ABRain board implements a learning, spiking neural network
that you can directly program from within Nengo.

This inexpensive board is aimed at introducing neuromorphics to a broad audience.
Explore and exploit the advantages of neuromorphic computing
in the classroom, the innovation lab, or your basement.

Use Nengo's friendly graphical interface
to run parts of your standard Nengo model
on power-efficient and fast neuromorphic hardware.
This self-contained board outperforms
most laptops in terms of both speed and efficiency.

Start by immediately running
any of the many demos that come with the board out of the box:
adaptive controllers, visual classifiers,
voice recognizers, and many more.
