ABRain board allows you to *own* and use a piece of the neuromorphic revolution.

ABRain board implements a learning, spiking neural network that you can directly program from within [Nengo]({{ site.baseurl }}/products/nengo.html).

This inexpensive board is aimed at introducing neuromorphics to a broad audience.  In the classroom, the innovation lab, or your basement, users can explore and exploit the advantages of neuromorphic computing.

Use Nengo's friendly graphical interface to run parts of your standard Nengo model on power-efficient and fast neuromorphic hardware.  This self-contained board outperforms most laptops in terms of both speed and efficiency.
