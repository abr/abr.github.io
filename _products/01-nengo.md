  Nengo is a suite of software tools
  that we develop and use to build
  large scale brain models.
  Nengo is our secret sauce,
  developed in the open and freely available
  to academic researchers and hobbyists.

Nengo is a software package for
building and simulating large-scale neural systems.

Nengo is a complete neural simulator, whether you like
yours with or without spikes, with or without deep
learning, and with or without online learning.  But,
Nengo's sweet spot is anything with dynamics and spikes.

Nengo is unique in its ability to put your neural application on
a wide variety of hardware -- including the latest neuromorphic hardware.
Compile your model to run on CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, supercomputers running MPI, 
the SpiNNaker neuromorphic chip, or the latest Loihi neuromorphic chip from Intel.

The best place to learn more about Nengo is our dedicated [Nengo website](http://nengo.ai).

Use Nengo to:
 - Build state-of-the-art spiking deep neural networks
 - Put your favorite model on efficient and fast neuromorphic hardware
 - Integrate many *kinds* of network in one model, spiking, non-spiking, deep, recurrent, with or without online learning.
 - Quickly prototype and test a new network using the interactive graphical interface
 - Explore the world of spiking neural networks with hundreds of [examples](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples.html) and [tutorials](???)


Among other things, Nengo has been used to
implement motor control, visual attention, serial recall,
action selection, working memory, attractor networks,
inductive reasoning, path integration,
and planning with problem solving.
Nengo was used to create a continuing research project,
[Spaun]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/spaun.html),
a model which combines many
of the previously listed models
in a single comprehensive whole.  Spaun has been featured
hundreds of [media stories]({{ site.baseurl }}/press) from around the world.

Nengo is free for individuals and academic research. For commercial licenses, see our [store].
