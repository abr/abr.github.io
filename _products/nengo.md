    - title: New neuromorphic tools
      description: >
        Let us extend Nengo to include a new tool for your
        team. Automate model building, convert non-spiking to spiking
        networks, visualize complex time-varying data and more.

research:
  title: Spaun
  content: >
    Nengo was used to create Spaun, the world's largest functional
    brain model, combining many different kinds of models into a
    single comprehensive whole. It can see, write, reason, and follow
    simple commands. Spaun has been featured in hundreds of media
    stories from around the world. Right now we consider it research,
    based on the book "How to Build a Brain,"
    but it hints at the power and flexibility of Nengo.

Nengo is a complete *brain maker*. In other words, Nengo allows you
to develop and run models with deep learning, online learning,
static weights, simple linear neurons, complex spiking neurons,
and everything in-between.

You can use Nengo to implement pretty much anything: DNNs, CNNs,
attractor networks, adaptive motor controllers, SLAM networks,
cognitive systems, you name it. It's used in industry and academia
to develop state-of-the-art neural networks -- to build brains.

Nengo is unique in its ability to put your neural application on
a wide variety of hardware -- including the latest neuromorphic hardware.
Compile your model to run on CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, supercomputers running MPI,
the latest Loihi neuromorphic chip from Intel,
or research neuromorphic chips like SpiNNaker.

Nengo is free for individuals and academic research.
