- World Economic Forum on Thursday announced its selection of the
  world's 61 most promising Technology Pioneers 2018, the most diverse
  class of such pioneers ever.
- Companies were selected for their potential to "transform society
  and industry" and "shape the Fourth Industrial Revolution," Fulvia
  Montresor of the World Economic Forum said.
- Applied Brain Research was chosen for its potential to transform
  artificial intelligence by enabling developers to rapidly build
  cognitive systems using the new class of neuromorphic computer
  chips, such as Intel's research chip Loihi, which were designed
  based on the human brain.

**Toronto, Ontario, Canada – June 21, 2018** –
[Applied Brain Research Inc. (ABR)](https://appliedbrainresearch.com/)
is a Canadian company
that produces a suite of neuromorphic AI software tools and
applications enabling developers to rapidly build AI systems that run
on all major computing platforms, including the emerging class of
neuromorphic computer chips, which were designed based on the human
brain, such as Intel's Loihi research chip. Neuromorphic applications
built with Nengo use less power to compute AI networks than CPUs or
GPUs, especially for advanced, highly recurrent, leading-edge AI
networks. On the way to ABR's long range goal to deliver the first
truly functional service robot control system, ABR has used Nengo to
build Reach, the world's first neuromorphic adaptive robotic reaching
system, and Spaun, the world's largest functional brain simulation.

ABR was selected among hundreds of candidates as one of the World
Economic Forum's "technology pioneers". Applied Brain Research
Inc. was spun-out of the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience (CTN) at
the University of Waterloo. Dr. Chris Eliasmith, Chief Science Officer
and co-CEO of ABR, studies the functioning of the human brain at the
CTN. Using Nengo, Dr. Eliasmith and his team created Spaun, the
world's largest functional human brain simulation, composed of over 6
million spiking neurons that performs twelve cognitive tasks,
including learning to follow arbitrary instruction sequences.

The World Economic Forum's Technology Pioneers community are
early-stage companies from around the world involved in the design,
development, and deployment of new technologies and innovations poised
to have a significant impact on business and society.

This year's cohort is the most diverse ever, both geographically and
in terms of gender. A majority (54%) come from regions outside the
United States and Silicon Valley, with 6 continents represented, and
25% of the companies are female-led. There is also a wide variety in
the technologies the pioneers focus on, including artificial
intelligence, big data and internet of things (IoT), biotechnology,
blockchain, autonomous vehicles, cyber security, vertical farming and
other agricultural advances, decentralised microgrids, and
robotics. The full list of technology pioneers can be found
[here](http://wef.ch/techpioneers18).

Following ABR's selection as Technology Pioneer, Chair and co-CEO
Peter Suma of ABR will be participating in the World Economic Forum
Annual Meeting of the New Champions. This meeting, also dubbed "Summer
Davos" will be held in Tianjin, China, September 18-20. Many Pioneers
will also attend the Annual Meeting in Davos, in January 2019, and
continue to contribute to Forum initiatives in the course of the next
two years.

"We welcome Applied Brain Research to this diverse group of technology
pioneers," says Fulvia Montresor, Head of Technology Pioneers at the
World Economic Forum. "ABR and its fellow pioneers are front and
centre in shaping the ongoing Fourth Industrial Revolution and we
believe they will be transforming society and industry in a positive
way in the years to come."

"We are honoured to be among this year's class of inspiring Technology
Pioneers," said Suma. "ABR has the opportunity to give the world
leading AI tools to capture the power of fully-parallel, asynchronous,
neural computation for advancing AI toward meaningful cognitive
computing. Our whole team is very appreciative of the support of the
World Economic Forum."

The Technology Pioneers were chosen by a [selection
committee](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/TP/WEF_TP_SelectionCommittee.pdf)
of more than 60 academics, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and
corporate executives. The committee based its decisions on criteria
including innovation, potential impact, and leadership. Past
recipients include Airbnb, Google, Kickstarter, Mozilla, Palantir
Technologies, Spotify, TransferWise, Twitter, and Wikimedia.

### About Applied Brain Research:
ABR is the maker of the world's leading multi-platform compiler for
building neuromorphic applications, [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai).
Neuromorphic computing improves the efficiency
of AI algorithms by computing with artificial spiking neurons using
less power than traditional CPU or GPU hardware. As stepping stones on
the way to ABR's long range goal to deliver the first truly functional
service robot control system, ABR has built Reach, the world's first
neuromorphic adaptive robotic reaching system, and Spaun, the world's
largest functional brain simulation.
