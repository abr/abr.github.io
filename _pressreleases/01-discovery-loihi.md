**Toronto, Ontario, Canada – April 27, 2018** - In a Canadian first, Applied
Brain Research Inc. (ABR), and Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE) are 
pleased to announce that Intel’s newest neuromorphic research chip, 
Loihi, will be demonstrated live at this year’s Discovery conference. The 
brain-like chip will be running several real-time, online learning artificial 
intelligence (AI) applications. The award-winning Discovery conference 
takes place at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre April 30 and May 1
 in Toronto, Ontario. This is the first time the Intel Loihi chip has been 
demonstrated in Canada. 
 
"OCE is looking forward to hosting ABR and Intel at Discovery 2018 as 
they demonstrate Loihi’s capabilities,” said Dr. Tom Corr, President and 
CEO of OCE. “Having supported ABR to improve their world leading brain 
model Spaun through a Medical Sciences Proof-of-Principle (MSc PoP) 
grant, OCE is very pleased to see ABR has become a key partner with Intel 
in the launch of the neuromorphic computing era on the show floor this 
year."
 
ABR created a number of AI applications using Nengo, ABR’s 
neuromorphic compiler, including a keyword speech recognition app and 
a neuromorphic robotic controller.  The speech recognition network was 
trained using deep learning and then converted to a spiking neural 
network using ABR’s neural network transfer methods.  The robotic 
controller uses an online non-linear adaptive algorithm running on Intel’s 
Loihi chip to control a Canadian Kinova Jaco2 arm.  The Loihi controller 
allows the Jaco2 arm to accurately reach to an object detected using a 
deep learning vision system, even when the friction, weight, and other 
properties of the arm change unpredictably.
 
 “Using Intel’s Loihi chip, the ABR team was able to demonstrate a wide 
range of AI algorithms including online and offline learning using 
supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, as well as 
inference and adaptive control. The combination of Intel’s Loihi chip and 
ABR’s Nengo framework begins to show the promise of neuromorphic 
computing for delivering real time learning algorithms that enable low-
power, high-performance AI computing,” said Mike Davies, head of 
Intel’s Neuromorphic Computing Program, Intel Labs. 
 
“ABR is now working to enable the full range of Nengo tools and networks 
to run on Intel’s Loihi platform and Intel’s Altera FPGAs, to provide a 
complete neuromorphic development tool stack for dynamic AI 
applications and computational neuroscience research,” said Chris 
Eliasmith, co-CEO and Chief Scientist of ABR.

### About Applied Brain Research
ABR is the maker of the world’s leading compiler for building
 neuromorphic applications, Nengo (http://www.nengo.ai). 
Neuromorphic computing aims to improve the efficiency of AI algorithms 
by computing with artificial spiking neurons using less power than 
traditional CPU or GPU hardware. Nengo is a general-purpose, multi-
platform neuromorphic applications development tool.
