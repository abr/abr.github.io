  Nengo is a suite of software tools
  that we develop and use to build
  large scale brain models.
  Nengo is our secret sauce,
  developed in the open and freely available
  to academic researchers and hobbyists.

Nengo is a complete neural simulator, whether you like yours with or without spikes, with or without deep learning, and with or without online learning. But, Nengo’s sweet spot is anything with dynamics and spikes.

Nengo is unique in its ability to put your neural application on a wide variety of hardware – including the latest neuromorphic hardware. Compile your model to run on CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, supercomputers running MPI, the SpiNNaker neuromorphic chip, or the latest Loihi neuromorphic chip from Intel.

Use Nengo to:
 <ul>
  <li class="mb-3">Build state-of-the-art spiking deep neural networks</li>
  <li class="mb-3">Put your favorite model on efficient and fast neuromorphic hardware</li>
  <li class="mb-3">Integrate many kinds of network in one model: spiking, non-spiking, deep, recurrent, with or without online learning</li>
  <li>Quickly prototype and test a new network using the interactive graphical interface</li>
  <li>Explore the world of spiking neural networks with hundreds of <a href="https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples.html">examples and tutorials</a></li>
 </ul>

Among other things, Nengo has been used to implement motor control, visual attention, serial recall, action selection, working memory, attractor networks, inductive reasoning, path integration, and planning with problem solving. Nengo was used to create a continuing research project, <a>Spaun</a>, a model which combines many of the previously listed models in a single comprehensive whole. Spaun has been featured in hundreds of <a>media stories</a> from around the world.

Nengo is free for individuals and academic research. For commercial licenses, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }} {% link contact.html %}">please contact us.</a>
