ABRain board implements a learning, spiking neural network that you can directly program from within Nengo.

This inexpensive board is aimed at introducing neuromorphics to a broad audience. Explore and exploit the advantages of neuromorphic computing in the classroom, the innovation lab, or your basement.

Use Nengo’s friendly graphical interface to run parts of your standard Nengo model on power-efficient and fast neuromorphic hardware. This self-contained board outperforms most laptops in terms of both speed and efficiency.

Start by immediately running any of the many demos that come with the board out of the box: adaptive controllers, visual classifiers, voice recognizers, and many more.

<h5> Working with researchers at the University of Waterloo, we are designing and testing an architecture that targets top-of-the-line FPGAs from both Intel and Xilinx.</h5>

Our small FPGA boards are just the beginning. To make neuromorphics easy and fast to deploy, we’re developing scaled-up versions that can target off-the-shelf, large FPGAs. This will provide a quick route to get the benefits of neuromorphic computing sooner rather than later.

This project is still in the early stages, but has already generated promising results, showing significantly better performance for high bandwidth and compute intensive use cases.

Given the large scale, we’re working with collaborators to develop special communication protocols to move spiking data efficiently on chip.
