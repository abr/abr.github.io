Travis' research focuses on studying the brain's motor control
system. Using modern control theoretic methods, such as operational
space control, nonlinear adaptive control, and dynamic movement
primitives, he has worked to develop biologically plausible spiking
neural networks that model the brain, capable of generating the same
diversity of behavioural phenomena and robust adaptation / learning
seen in primates.

He received his undergraduate degree in computer science at Acadia
University, with a thesis discussing the algebraic properties of
template-guided DNA recombination. His masters degree was in
computer science at the University of Waterloo, and focused on the
development of the Neural Optimal Control Hierarchy (NOCH); a
biologically plausible framework for large-scale models of the motor
control system. His Ph.D. was in systems design engineering at the
University of Waterloo, where he presented the Recurrent
Error-driven Adaptive Control Hierarchy (REACH) model; a
large-scale, fully spiking neural model of the motor cortices and
cerebellum able to account for data from 19 studies from a
behavioural level down to the level of single spiking neurons.
