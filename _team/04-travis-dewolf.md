Travis is a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Waterloo. He received his undergraduate degree in computer science at Acadia University, with a thesis discussing the algebraic properties of template-guided DNA recombination. His masters degree was in computer science at the University of Waterloo, and focussed on the development of the Neural Optimal Control Hierarchy (NOCH); a biologically plausible framework for large-scale models of the motor control system. His Ph.D. was in systems design engineering at the University of Waterloo, where he presented the Recurrent Error-driven Adaptive Control Hierarchy (REACH) model; a large-scale, fully spiking neural model of the motor cortices and cerebellum able to account for data from 19 studies from a behavioural level down to the level of single spiking neurons.
