Travis's goal is to develop a formal mathematical model capturing the
function and interaction of the neurobiological subsystems involved in
motor control. The focus of his PhD was to build a spiking neuron level
model of motor learning across the basal ganglia, motor cortex, and
cerebellum. This involved research into the neural architecture of the
motor control system, exploring the plausibility of various machine
learning methods, and investigating biologically realistic
alternatives.
