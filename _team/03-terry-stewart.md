Terry is a post-doctoral research associate working with Chris Eliasmith
and Paul Thagard. His initial training was as an engineer (B.A.Sc. in
Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, 1999); his masters
involved applying experimental psychology on simulated robots (M.Phil.
in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Sussex,
2000), and his Ph.D. was on cognitive modelling (Ph.D. in Cognitive
Science, Carleton University, 2007).

He believes that making progress in understanding any phenomenon as
complex as cognition requires the construction of computational
models. The primary role of these models is to test theories: as
theories become more complex, we need computational models to let us
determine the quantitative predictions of these theories. These models
should also be _mechanistic_. That is, they should be process models
where the behaviour of the overall system is caused by the interaction
of internal components over time. These components should then
correspond to the components of the real system. To achieve this, his
main research interests are in the development of modelling tools to
support large-scale cognitive models. This has involved both
high-level cognitive architectures (such as ACT-R) and detailed neural
models (such as the Neural Engineering Framework). Of particular
interest is models involving cognitive reasoning, experience-based
learning, and reinforcement learning to interact with a complex
environment. In concert with this, Terry has worked on statistical tools
for comparing modelling results with empirical results, and how such
results should be interpretted. In particular, instead of the standard
approaches of finding best-fit parameter settings based on minimizing
the mean squared error, he advocate finding a range of parameter
settings for which the model and reality are not statistically
significantly different.
