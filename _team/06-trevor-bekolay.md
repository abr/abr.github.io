Trevor’s primary research interest is in learning and memory.
In his Master’s degree, he explored how to do supervised,
unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in networks
of biologically plausible spiking neurons.
In his PhD, he applied this knowledge to
the domain of speech to explore how sounds coming into the ear
become high-level linguistic representations,
and how those representations become
sequences of vocal tract movements that produce speech.

Trevor is also passionate about reproducible science,
particularly when complex software pipelines are involved.
In 2013, he started a development effort
to reimplement the Nengo neural simulator from scratch in Python,
which has now grown to a project
with over 20 contributors around the world.
