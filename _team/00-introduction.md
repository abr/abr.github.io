Applied Brain Research was spun out of the [Computational Neuroscience Research 
Group (CNRG)](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca).  The CNRG is one of the core groups in the [Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience (CTN)](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca), which is a world class research centre focussed on building computational models of brain function.
