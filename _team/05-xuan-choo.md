Xuan has a rather wide set of research interests.

First, he is interested in working and long-term memory.
How does the brain remember things, and what sorts of representations
are used to do so? How does the brain integrate the different sensory
inputs in working memory, and what is the underlying structure? How
does the brain "decide" what to put into long-term memory and how does
it do it?

Second, Xuan is interested in general cognition and large-scale model design.
He studies and models how the brain performs tasks like
concept generalization and problem solving. He is also interested in
the problem of integration: how does one build a system that seamlessly melds
sensory input, with decision making and problem solving, with motor
output, in order to perform highly complex tasks?

Finally, Xuan is interested in
language learning, representation, and processing.
Languages come in many forms:
written languages, spoken languages, sign languages, and others.
The brain is able to make sense of it all. Is there an
underlying general framework that the brain uses to represent these
different forms of languages, or does each form have its own specific
framework? Additionally, how does the brain learn languages? Are
multiple sensory inputs required to learn a language, or is just one
sensory input enough?
