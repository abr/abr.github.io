Trevor's primary research interest is in learning and memory.
In his masters degree, he explored how to do
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
in networks of biologically plausible spiking neurons.
In his PhD, he is applying this knowledge to
the domain of audition to explore
how sounds coming into the ear
improve our ability to produce speech.
