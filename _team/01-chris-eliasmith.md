Chris is the co-inventor of the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF),
the Neural Engineering Objects (Nengo) software environment, and 
the Semantic Pointer Architecture, all of which are dedicated to understanding how the brain works. His team has
developed the Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network (Spaun)
which is the most realistic functional brain simulation yet developed
as of its publication in November, 2012.  He won the prestigious [2015 NSERC Polanyi Award] (http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Prizes-Prix/Polanyi-Polanyi/Profiles-Profils/Eliasmith-Eliasmith_eng.asp) for his research.

Chris is the Canada Research Chair in Theoretical Neuroscience. At the
University of Waterloo Chris is jointly appointed in the Philosophy,
Systems Design Engineering faculties, as well he is cross-appointed to
the Computer Science department. Chris has supervised students in each
of these departments as well as in Biology and Psychology.

Chris is the director of the
[Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience (CTN)](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca/)
at the University of Waterloo. The Centre brings together researchers
across many faculties as diverse as math, engineering, arts and
science who are interested in computational and theoretical models of
neural systems.

The
[Computational Neuroscience Research Group (CNRG)](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/)
is Chris’ research lab which is associated with the CTN.
The CNRG site contains the most up-to-date information
on Chris’ team’s research.

Chris has published two books:
[*How to Build a Brain*](http://nengo.ca/build-a-brain)
(Oxford University Press)
and his seminal
[*Neural Engineering*](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/nef.html).

When he is not pushing the boundaries of theoretical neuroscience
forward or hanging out with his team at the CNRG, Chris spends time
with his family and occasionally straps on the blades for a game of
hockey near his home in Waterloo.  He has a [Bacon-Erdos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Bacon_number) 
number of 8.
