Daniel Rasmussen is interested in general intelligence: what is it,
how does it develop, what are its components, and how might we model
it. He is particularly interested in incorporating large scale
adaptability into these models, so that we can understand how they
come to be and how they develop into the future. This has led to his
interest in reinforcement learning, where he seeks to understand how we
could learn from experience to build up the complex processing of
intelligence.
