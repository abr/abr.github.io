Daniel's research is motivated by a general interest in building more flexible,
adaptive computational systems.  This has led to work in a range of different
areas, including computational neuroscience, (hierarchical) reinforcement learning,
and deep learning.  Daniel works to build hybrid systems that combine these (and other)
approaches, in order to best leverage the strengths of each method.

In 2014 Daniel completed his PhD at the University of Waterloo, where his thesis involved
developing the first neural model capable of performing hierarchical reinforcement learning.
From 2014--2016 he worked as a postdoc at Princeton University, where he developed a
Hessian-free optimization package for deep learning, with the aim to apply these methods
to RL.  Now at ABR he works to expand these and other projects from their academic origins
into practical, state-of-the-art applications.
