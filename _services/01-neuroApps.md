We’ve built our reputation on developing proof-of-concept applications of neuromorphic technology.

Whether it’s robotics, semantic processing, or deep learning applications, we’ve built state-of-the-art solutions for a variety of clients to date (shhhhh… we can’t tell you about all of them). Needless to say we’ve built up a core expertise in building client-requested applications that target spiking neuromorphics.

Whether you know you want a deployable application, or just want to see what benefits there are for your favorite app when put into spikes, we can help. Our in-house expertise covers all common application areas and methods. Challenge us with a new one – we love challenges.

Every project is different, so <a href="{{ site.baseurl }} {% link contact.html %}"> contact us </a> for an introductory call.
