We've built our reputation on developing
proof-of-concept applications
of neuromorphic technology.

<img src="/img/talk-code.jpg" align="left" width="120">
Whether it's robotics, semantic processing, or deep learning applications,
we've built state-of-the-art solutions
for a variety of clients to date
(shhhhh... we can't tell you about all of them).
Needless to say we've built up a core expertise
in building client-requested applications
that target spiking neuromorphics.

Whether you know you want a deployable application,
or just want to see what benefits there are
for your favorite app when put into spikes, we can help.
Our in-house expertise covers
all common application areas and methods.
Challenge us with a new one -- we love challenges.
