We've built our reputation on developing proof-of-concept applications of neuromorphic technology.

Whether is robotics, semantic processing, or deep learning applications, we've built state-of-the-art solutions for a variety of clients to date.  Shhhhh... we can't tell you about all of them.  But needless to say we've built up a core expertise in building client-requested applications that target spiking neuromorphics.
