A Nengo backend for your hardware makes it instantly useable by the broader community.

We have built backends for a wonderful variety of hardware systems, including for analog/digital hybrid chips, pure digital chips, synchronous and asynchronous designs, you name it.  We've parterned with fortune 500 companies, academic labs, and brand new startups.

Building a useable, tested and flexible software stack is a huge challenge.  Nengo 2.0 was designed with deployment across many different hardware targets as a central goal.  Take advantage of a mature environment that's been used by thousands of modelers and has years of in the field testing.

We'd be happy to discuss details.  Contact us to set up a meeting: info@appliedbrainresearch.com.
