A Nengo backend for your hardware makes it instantly useable by the broader community.

We have built backends for a wonderful variety of hardware systems, including analog/digital hybrid chips, pure digital chips, synchronous and asynchronous designs, you name it. We’ve parterned with Fortune 500 companies, academic labs, and brand new startups.

Building a usable, tested and flexible software stack is a huge challenge. Nengo was designed with a central goal of deploying models on many different hardware platforms. Take advantage of a mature environment that’s been used by thousands of modelers and has years of in-the-field testing.

We’d be happy to discuss details. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact.html %}">Contact us</a> to set up a meeting.
