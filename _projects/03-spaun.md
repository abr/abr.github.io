  Spaun is the the world's largest functional brain model.
  It can respond intelligently to questions, remember digits,
  gambleâ€”all with only 2.5 million neurons.

In 2012, we unveiled Spaun, a 2.5-million-neuron model
of the brain that bridged the gap between
neural activity and biological function.

Spaun, short for
Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network,
is composed of groups of neurons that
perform functions necessary to complete cognitive tasks.
It flexibly coordinates those groups
depending on the cognitive task being performed.

Spuan receives input as images
of handwritten digits,
which it processes through
a monocular visual system,
and produces output as
handwritten digits,
which it produces through
a motor system driving a simulated
three-link arm.
Spaun can perfom eight cognitive tasks with digits:
copy drawing, image recognition, gambling,
list memory, counting, question answering,
rapid variable creation, and fluid reasoning.
