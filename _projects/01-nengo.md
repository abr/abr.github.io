  Nengo is a suite of software tools
  that we develop and use to build
  large scale brain models.
  Nengo is our secret sauce,
  developed in the open and freely available
  to researchers and hobbyists.

Nengo is a software package for
building and simulating large-scale neural systems.

To use Nengo, you define groups of neurons
in terms of what they represent,
and then form connections
between neural groups
in terms of what computation should be performed
on those representations.
Nengo then uses the
[Neural Engineering Framework (NEF)](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/nef.html)
to solve for the appropriate synaptic connection weights
to achieve this desired computation.
Nengo also supports various kinds of learning.
Nengo helps make detailed spiking neuron models
that implement complex high-level cognitive algorithms.

Among other things, Nengo has been used to
implement motor control, visual attention, serial recall,
action selection, working memory, attractor networks,
inductive reasoning, path integration,
and planning with problem solving.
Nengo was used to create
[Spaun]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/spaun.html),
a model which combines many
of the previously listed models
in a single comprehensive whole.
