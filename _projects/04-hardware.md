  We believe brain-inspired hardware
  will run the next generation of AI systems.
  We provide a platform for developing integrated AI systems
  with neuromorphic hardware.

We provide a platform for developing
integrated AI systems
with the next generation
of computer hardware:
inspired by the brain,
powerful,
and extremely efficient.

ABR is at the forefront
of [neuromorphic engineering](http://www.artificialbrains.com/),
providing software for several pieces
neuromorphic hardware.
We work closely with
the [Neurogrid](http://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/)
and [SpiNNaker](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/)
groups to enable their
powerful, efficient hardware designs to
perform cognitive tasks.
