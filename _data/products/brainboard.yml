  title: Large-scale Nengo Brain Boards
  content: >
    Our small Nengo Brain Boards are just the beginning, developed to
    be inexpensive and targeting DE-1 and Pynq FPGA boards. To make
    neuromorphics easy and fast to deploy at scale, we're developing
    larger and more capable versions with researchers at the
    University of Waterloo, which target large off-the-shelf Intel and
    Xilinx FPGAs. This will provide a quick route to get the benefits
    of neuromorphic computing sooner rather than later.

    Given the large scale, we're working with collaborators to
    develop special communication protocols to move spiking data
    efficiently on chip. This project is still in the early stages,
    but has already generated promising results, showing significantly
    better performance for high bandwidth and compute intensive use
    cases. Take a look at
    [this conference paper](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/morcos2018.html)
    for more information about the design and performance of our
    early Pynq implementation of Nengo Brain Board.
