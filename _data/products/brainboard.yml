  title: Large-scale Nengo Brain Boards
  content: >
    Our small Nengo Brain Boards are just the beginning, developed to
    be inexpensive and targeting DE1-SoC and PYNQ-Z1 FPGA boards. These
    initial proof-of-concept Brain Boards offer encouraging results and
    motivate us to actively continue development! Take a look at
    [this conference paper](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/morcos2018.html)
    for more information about the design and performance of our
    early PYNQ implementation of Nengo Brain Board.
    See also, the [paper presentation](https://github.com/bmorcos/presentations/blob/master/FPT18/NEF_on_PYNQ_FPT18.pdf)
    and [talk](https://github.com/bmorcos/presentations/blob/master/FPT18/NEF_on_PYNQ_FPT18_talk.mp4)
    for further explanations.


    To make neuromorphics easy and fast to deploy at scale, beyond our currently
    available Nengo Brain Boards, we're developing larger and more capable
    versions with researchers at the University of Waterloo, which target larger
    off-the-shelf Intel and Xilinx FPGAs. This will provide a quick route to get
    the benefits of neuromorphic computing sooner rather than later.

    Given the large scale and increasing complexity, we're working with
    collaborators to develop special communication protocols to move spiking
    data efficiently on chip. This project is still in the early stages,
    but has already generated promising results, showing significantly
    better performance for high bandwidth and compute intensive use
    cases.
