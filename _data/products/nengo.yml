  title: Spaun
  content: >
    Nengo was used to create Spaun, the world's largest functional
    brain model, combining many different kinds of models into a
    single comprehensive whole. It can see, write, reason, and follow
    simple commands. Spaun has been featured in hundreds of media
    stories from around the world. Right now we consider it research,
    based on the book "How to Build a Brain,"
    but it hints at the power and flexibility of Nengo.
