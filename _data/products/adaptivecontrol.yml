shortDescription: >
  We have developed and patented an adaptive control method that
  guarantees improvement over standard PID control. Not only does this
  algorithm introduce robust self-tuning, it can be run efficiently on
  standard hardware or next generation neuromorphic hardware.

      When applied to a Jaco<sup>2</sup> robotic arm, the adaptive
      controller can compensate for unknown forces and use novel
      tools.

    To effectively implement force controllers, accurate models of the
    system dynamics are required. Nonlinear adaptive control methods
    provide means of compensating for inaccurate models online, and
    are provably stable and at least as effective as standard PID
    control.

    Our research has shown how nonlinear adaptive control can be
    implemented in neural networks to control robotic simulations. We
    applied this control on the Kinova Jaco<sup>2</sup> robotic arm by
    first developing a force-control interface to the arm (available
    publicly on Github), and then building a hybrid implementation of
    adaptive neural control using Nengo (which we have also made
    available publicly) and neuromorphic hardware. Our demonstration
    shows the system adapting to unexpected forces acting upon the arm
    in real-time, showcasing the utility of low-power, adaptive,
    embedded robotic systems.
