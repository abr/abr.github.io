Nengo is a complete neural simulator,
running models with deep learning, online learning, static weights,
simple linear neurons, complex spiking neurons,
and everything in-between.

You can use Nengo to implement pretty much anything: DNNs, CNNs,
attractor networks, adaptive motor controllers, SLAM networks,
cognitive systems, you name it. It's used in industry and academia
to develop state-of-the-art neural networks.

Nengo is unique in its ability to put your neural application on
a wide variety of hardware -- including the latest neuromorphic hardware.
Compile your model to run on CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, supercomputers running MPI,
the latest Loihi neuromorphic chip from Intel,
or research neuromorphic chips like SpiNNaker.

Nengo is free for individuals and academic research.
