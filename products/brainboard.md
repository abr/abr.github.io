The Nengo Brain Board implements a learning, spiking neural network
that you can directly program from within Nengo.
Use Nengo to build brains in hardware.

These inexpensive boards open neuromorphics up to anyone.
Explore and exploit the advantages of neuromorphic computing
in the classroom, the innovation lab, or your basement.

Use Nengo's friendly graphical interface
to run parts of your standard Nengo model
on power-efficient and fast neuromorphic hardware.
These self-contained boards outperform
most laptops in terms of both speed and efficiency.

Start by running one of the many demos
that come with the board out of the box:
visual classifiers, adaptive controllers,
reinforcement learning, and more!
