Our novel controller uses machine learning
and artificial intelligence methods
to improve standard industrial control, including robotics.

These patented techniques build on
decades of research from MIT
into efficient methods for building robust adaptive controllers
for nonlinear systems.

Regardless of whether you're using
position, force, or any other control target,
our addition of a neural network into the controller
is mathematically guaranteed
to improve the control outcome
compared to even a well-tuned PID controller.

If desired, the controller
can continue to adapt while in use
to account for unknown or expected deviations
from original tuning conditions,
whether that's because of wear and tear on the plant,
or a change in environmental dynamics.

Best of all, we can implement
the entire controller on state-of-the-art, efficient neuromorphic hardware
(or standard hardware, if you already have it).
